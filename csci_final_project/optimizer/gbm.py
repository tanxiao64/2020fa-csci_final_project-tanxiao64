    After a follow up discussion with my manager recently, he is a little concerned about the IP component of the
    application of this optimizer. As a result, I decided not to implement this and spent more time on the workflow
    and other topics of this project. Instead of GBM, I added a basic bruteforce optimizer which searches the full space.
